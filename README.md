# GameSetMatch

### Spring Boot and React.js Application hosted on AWS supported with MySQL database.

#### This is a tournament hosting and scheduling full-stack service built in a team of 6 as part of a sponsored project with Amazon.

#### For my part of the project, I specialized in creating and implementing the scheduling algorithm, while also providing support to the MySQL and front-end system. I created an algorithm for user matching based on Bipartite graph matching between user availabilities and then applying on a greedy maximum independent set algorithm on the transformed matched graphs. I then extended the system to efficiently support the maximum user-base of 300 against the highest tournament thresholds under 4 seconds. The algorithm prioritized user availability but also considered user skill and balancing different tournament formats.

#### The team worked in a waterfall development method keeping detailed documentation (Project Plan, Design Documents, Test Plan) and meeting artifacts. The system was successfully demoed to our sponsors.
